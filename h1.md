# Salt
*After multiple failed attempts to complete the exercise on my PC and other virtual machines, I gave it one more attempt on a new virtual machine.*
> The following exercise has been done on a Virtual machine (Ubuntu server 22.04.2).
# Install Virtualization Environment
Updating the workspace

    $ sudo apt-get update
After the update, I installed the virtualization environment

    $ sudo apt-get -y install virtualbox vagrant micro
After installation, I created a directory for the virtualization environment

    $ mkdir saltdemo; cd saltdemo
# Ready made Vagrantfile for three computers
*Since i am working on a virtualbox VM, I had to connect to the virtual machine through ssh connection in order to enable copy/paste.*
The first step was to find out my IP-address

    $ ip address

<br>Next, I typed the aforementioned IP-address into Putty, and opened SSH connection to my VM.

<br>After logging in to the virtual machine, I moved into the 'saltdemo' directory, and created a Vagrantfile

    $ micro Vagrantfile
I pasted the required Vagrantfile contents with <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Insert</kbd> keys.
# Run Three Computers
After creating the Vagrantfile, I attempted to run the 3 computers with the following command

    $ vagrant up

<br>Eventually, I got the following error

<br>In an attempt to fix the problem, I did what i thought was the most logical move; to update the IP-addresses in the Vagrantfile to match the IP ranges.

    $ sudo nano Vagrantfile

<br>However, after running 'vagrant up', I ran into another error

>I could not figure out a way to get around this problem.

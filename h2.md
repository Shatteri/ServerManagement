# H2
> The following exercise was done on 2 Virtual machines (Ubunut servers 22.04.2).
<br>The machines are called "saltmachine" and "saltmachine2".
# Install Master
I installed master on 'saltmachine' using the following command:

      $ sudo apt-get -y install salt-master
Next, I checked whether the Master had a firewall or not.

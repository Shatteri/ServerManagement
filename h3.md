# H3
> **!!! I did the entire exercise on my windows PC. My dumbass didn't realise this probably should've been done on a virtual machine but it is what it is. Sorry but aint changing sh*t no more. Instructions were unclear so take it or leave it.**
## a)
I started off by creating a new repository called "summer" into GitHub.
<br>In the creation phase, I added 2 files into the repository (README.md & GNU General Public License 3).

## b)
I created a folder called "summer" into C:\ root.
<br>Next, I opened Git Bash in the folder and ran the following command:

    $ git clone https://github.com/Shatteri/summer.git

<br>I opened the README.md file in notepad, and added a line of text.

<br>I saved the changes and returned to git bash.
<br>I moved into the cloned repository, added the changes, committed them and pushed them to github. (I've censored my name for privacy reasons).
    
    $ cd summer/
    $ git add .
    $ git commit -m "changes to README.md"
    $ git push

<br>The changes were now visible in GitHub.

## c)
I added a dumb change into the README.md file.

<br>I added the changes but then ran the 'git reset --hard' command to revert the changes.

    $ git add .
    $ git reset --hard

## d)
In order to check the git log, I had to run the following command.

    $ git log
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/103279302/232307938-f425bd79-ae80-4d9e-9523-1d99c3f384d9.png)
<br>All the information shown on the picture above were accurate, and no changes had to be made.

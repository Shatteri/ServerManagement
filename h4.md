## a)
I started off by navigating to the /srv/salt directory and creating a new directory: 'shell'.

    $ cd /srv/salt
    $ sudo mkdir shell
Next, I created a 'init.sls' file and 'hello.sh' file into shell directory, including the contents of the script file.

    $ cd shell
    $ sudo nano init.sls

    $ sudo nano hello.sh

Next, I changed the permissions of the file so that I could run it.

    $ sudo chmod 755 hello.sh
Now it was time to test it.
    
    $ ./hello.sh

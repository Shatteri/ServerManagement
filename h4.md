# H4
>The following exercise was done on 2 Virtual machines (Ubuntu server 22.04.2).
<br>The machines are called "saltmachine" (master) and "saltmachine2" (slave).

## a)
I started off by navigating to the /srv/salt directory and creating a new directory: 'shell'.

    $ cd /srv/salt
    $ sudo mkdir shell
Next, I created a 'init.sls' file and 'hello.sh' file into shell directory, including the contents of the script file.

    $ cd shell
    $ sudo nano init.sls

    $ sudo nano hello.sh

Next, I changed the permissions of the file so that I could run it.

    $ sudo chmod 755 hello.sh
Now it was time to test it.
    
    $ ./hello.sh

Next, I ran the script on salt to the slave using the following command:

    $ sudo salt '*' state.apply shell

<br>In order to check whether the shellscript works on slave computer, I checked the directory permissions.

    $ shell
    $ cd /usr/local/bin
    $ ls -l

<br>As we see in the image above, the permissions are '-rwxr-xr-x'. The permissions correspond to the numeric values: 755.

## b)
I started off by creating a new directory 'script' under /srv/salt

    $ cd /srv/salt
    $ sudo mkdir script
    $ cd script
Next I created a 'init.sls' file

    $ sudo nano init.sls
I gave it the following contents:

<br> Next, I created the 'hello.py' python file.
    
    $ sudo nano hello.py
I gave it the following contents:

<br>I first ran the script on master. In order to do that, I had to modify the permissions of the python file.
    
    $ sudo chmod 755 hello.py
    $ ./hello.py

<br>Next, I ran the script on salt and checked the results on slave.

    $ sudo salt '*' state.apply script

    $ script

## c)
>completed in exercise a & b section.

## d)
I started off by creating a directory 'binary' to /srv/salt path.

    $ sudo mkdir binary
    $ cd binary
Next off, to create a single binary program, I created a 'hello.c' file inside the 'binary' directory.

    $ sudo nano hello.c
I added the following contents

<br>I then turned the file into a binary file

    $ sudo gcc -o hello hello.c
I then ran the binary file on master.

    $ ./hello

<br>To run it on salt, I had to create a init.sls file with the following contents:

    $ sudo nano init.sls
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/103279302/233838634-2fe67474-0a3f-4828-ab22-d240d882e42e.png)
<br>I could then run it on salt
   
    $sudo salt '*' state.apply binary
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/103279302/233838577-2b668430-74ee-4622-bbbb-33ef573d77b9.png)
<br>Next, I checked the results on slave
>I could not run the program on the slave machine.
><br>I did the whole exercise again to check whether I had missed something (hence the changes in filename in the image below), but it would  still give me the same error message.

<br>As of now, I haven't found the solution for this issue.
